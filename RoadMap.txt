The Roadmap

Version Alpha 0.1 (Status: in progress)

Contents 

# Four new ships: the Starcab, the Navant (a Heavy Shuttle equivalent), the Chasseire (a small Interceptor) and the Astrominer (a Cargo Miner hybrid.)

# A new region was reworked from Pherkad and surroundings into the Southern Periphery (reworking missions to accommodate the new planets)

# A new start; where you can take a larger more forgiving loan and get the starter ships or take the Lastram Federationâ€™s Starliner Program and begin your journey as a simple starcab pilot with a new tutorial.
