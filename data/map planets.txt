planet "Andaria Bay"
	attributes factory pirate south "south pirate"
	description "Andaria Bay, a relatively unattractively dry and hilly planet, is home to a number of pirate bases that interdict the trade route between the Southern Rim, the Periphery, the Tarazed sector, and the eastern Dirt Belt mining settlements."
	description `Competition over the planet by regional powers is notoriously fierce and petty, with some warlord feuds having lasted for multiple centuries. While this competitiveness has created some of the most developed - yet illegitimate - manufacturing industries in this area of human space, "Andarian" has become a common term for a particularly uncivilized and mercurial person with a wry sense of humor.`
	spaceport "This spaceport serving one of the major settlements on Andaria is neither particularly safe nor pretty, but it is at least well defended, as it's peripheral laser turrets remind everybody who considers paying the toll to land here safely. More likely, it's meant to protect this warlord's wealth from the neighbouring ones' armies, but the spaceport toll happens to be a profitable side venture as well."
	spaceport "In the distance, you can see rising columns of smoke. It's not clear whether this is from another new manufacturing complex, the remains of one, or a recent battle."

planet Anuage
	attributes periphery research tourism
	landscape land/strato01
	description "During the early days of space exploration, it was believed that Anuage was an Earth-like world, and so it was a prime target for early colonization efforts in the Southern Rim. But later atmospheric analysis showed that it was closer to Venus in its composition, and so the colony ship sent to settle Anuage was redirected to assist in the settlement of its icier brother, Phenixia."
	description "While the cloudy world was ignored for most of of the system's history, when the first caravans from the Deep arrived in the 2600s there was a qualitative jump in industrial capacity, to the point that a new attempt was made to colonize Anuage. A new model of colony ship named 'Cloud City' was pioneered to settle Anuage, and it remains the first and only one of its type established here."
	description "Anuage is also famous for hosting the Strato GX, a racing competition across the planet."
	spaceport "The Port is a spire structure located in the center of city, where ships dock and take off regularly, at the center is a elevator that takes you to the more recreational, commercial and business areas. Larger ships enter at the base where it has more space and some don't even land, just dump their cargo for the drones to unload it and take off again. There is even some who are using the upper floors to do attempt some sky gliding, a popular sport in this cloudy world."

planet Austral
	attributes farming periphery sanctuary tourism
	landscape land/cordillera
	description "Austral is a quiet, Earth-like world with a single large continent and a few islands surrounded by ocean. Its first settlers, wanting to escape the crowdedness that plagued Earth, scattered across the continent and established thousands of small independent villages, instead of large urban centers that are more common elsewhere."
	description "Being an idyllic agrarian world, Austral is a popular retirement destination, with a population recently reaching two hundred million inhabitants. Due to the planet's remoteness and the decentralized nature of the settlements, most Austral villages are not shown on local maps of the planet. This makes Austral a perfect hideout for wanted individuals across the galaxy, who wish to disappear among the numerous uncatalogued settlements in the middle of the vast continent."
	spaceport "The spaceport makes up a small section of the largest city, which happens to be located on the shores of Austral's all-encompassing ocean. From the spaceport, ships land and discharge whatever they are carrying to a warehouse, where the cargo is sorted to various depots and sent by land, sea, or air to its destination."

planet Columbia
	attributes factory periphery tourism
	landscape land/ncity1
	description "Columbia is the twin planet of Sao Pedro and the second colonized in the Periphery. Established as an manufacturing world, its lower gravity allowed heavy industries to take a foothold here, however the low elevation of the land coupled with the monstrous tidal waves and Storms resulted in a low growth in the early days of the colony."
	description "All that changed during the Caravan Era, in an effort to reduce overcrowding in Sao Pedro, a series of land reclamation works and infrastructure projects made planet safe for long term habitation, resulting in a population boom that brought prosperity to Columbia and relief for Sao Pedro."
	description "Today Columbia is a center of entertainment for the periphery with extreme sports dominating the ratings with surfing being the most watched."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located on a crater giving a distinct Ring shape."

planet Ibixia
	attributes moon periphery research tourism
	landscape land/frostyvillage
	description "Ibixia is the first moon of Phenixia and the only one that humans can inhabit. When the South was initially settled, Ibixia was used as a stopover for repairing ships in long hauls; throughout the ages the colony found new life as a tourist destination and education center, especially for the developing middle class of the Dirt Belt and beyond. As such, more than half of its residents are off-world students. Today the moon is home to various ski resorts, mountain climbing and winter homes, courtesy of the local government who provides substantial benefits to workers as well as large universities which attract many to learn."
	description "In addition to the overarching education industry, Ibixia also houses the headquarters of Ikaros Engineering."
	spaceport "Although not outdated in any sense, the spaceport has a distinctive vintage style from the early days of exploration. The main terminal is littered with advertisements for many resorts and schools in the zone and many buses come and go from the terminal. The port is located some kilometers of the main settlement, which resembles the alpine villages that you would see in antique movies. Just outside the the village there is a large campus, where students gain their qualifications for the many industries in the system."

planet Innova

	landscape land/nbeach1
	description "Inova was once a thriving colony in the Periphery. However, during a particularly gruesome fight between the planetary miltia and a band of pirates in orbit, debris from the battle rained over the major cities and intensifying already prevalent dust storms across the planet, resulting in a mass exodus from the colony. Today there are few human settlements remaining on Inova, and those that do live in under abject conditions."
	description "Although the landing beacon for the spaceport is still active, what's left of the old spaceport has sunk into the sea, leaving a large crater hole in its wake."

planet Phenixia
	attributes factory periphery research urban
	landscape land/ncity2
	description "Phenixia is on the far edge of Alzyria's habitable zone. Although that means its climate is very Earth-like, it is much colder even at the equator. Despite this, Phenixia is home to just over a hundred and seventy million people from all regions of space, and thanks to its vast resources, it is a major industrial and scientific hub in the Periphery."
	description "The largest industries on the planet include Paradeigm Group, who employ a tenth of the world's population, and Luzon Dynamics, who develop and manufacture all kinds of outfits."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located inside the main city near the government house, and is divided into two 'rings.' The innermost ring is the oldest, built when the planet was first discovered. Although it was once well trafficked, now it isn't capable of servicing most modern freighters and only processes smaller starships; the oldest facilities are closed off and is in the process of being converted into a museum. The outermost ring, built a hundred years ago, is one of the largest spaceports in the South, handling everything from massive food-laden bulk freighters to shipbuilding and engineering convoys."
	spaceport "Just outside the planetary spaceport, there is a private port owned by Paradeigm. Occasionally it's possible to see bright flashes inside one of the hangars."

planet Providence
	attributes fishing periphery religious sanctuary
	landscape land/ncity13
	description "Providence is a very religious world here in the Periphery. Established by Christian missionaries in the 25th century, the quiet colony grew to house a significant population who took sanctuary here."
	description "A popular tale found on Providence tells of a pirate crew, who were astonished by the kindness of the Misoans even during their attempt to sack a local village. Although there are many variations on whether the pirates were local outcasts or from other planets, it always consistently ends with many of the crew defecting to establish peaceful lives here."
	spaceport "While quite small for a planetary spaceport serving a planet this populated, the spaceport has the ability to serve large ships. The spaceport is of an older design, where ships park in rows adjoining a terminal building that connects to the spaceport's main complex."
	spaceport "The spaceport serves the oldest city on Providence, which also happens to be the location of the first church here. It is a popular destination for offworlders, who come to admire the architecture and the natural valleys of the moon. One of the most well-known sights in this part of the galaxy is the gas giant Natal setting under Providence' horizon, creating a spectacular vista."

	landscape land/ncity6
	description "Sao Pedro is a tropical world dominated by vast jungles that stretch across continents. In the plains and valleys the trees are replaced by farms that reach millions of hectares in size, all to feed the ever increasing population of the local urban centers, housing millions working in factory complexes and office buildings. Sao Pedro is also home to Taurika Defense Group, one of the largest weapon manufacturers in the South."
	description "As the first planet to be settled in this region, its customs and culture differ somewhat from the other planets in the Periphery. Many people from all corners of space come here to Sao Pedro's pristine beaches during the summer."
	spaceport "The spaceport, a collection of dozens of ring-shaped platforms, is located by a lake in sight of the capital city, constructed recently to accommodate the large influx of tourists and immigrants. The spaceport complex is lavish with countless hotels, shopping malls, and casinos; it's not unlikely that more than a few of them are associated with the mafias in the city."

Those settle here did so to escape the chaos that was Earth after the Turf Wars with many seeking a chance to start over. Since then half a millennium has passed, and sprawling cities cover much of its surface."
	description "In addition to being one of the major metropolitan centers of the Galactic South, Solace is the economic center of the Southern Periphery with many corporation having branches that serve the Galactic south as well as being home to the Delta V Corporation, makers of Plasma engines and everything associated to rocketry as well as Oberon Consortium, the largest construction company in the South.

Due to constant instances of espionage with the Syndicate, entrance is strictly prohibited to non-employees, and only the most trusted of people may access its facilities. Built during the Caravan era, Solon Station was at the cutting edge of station capabilities and along with Ibixia and now Winter, are the centers of research for the Periphery."

	landscape land/nstation1
	description "Centuries ago, Pherkad was a prosperous system thanks to the mineral deposits in Wolfradia to the Point that Vale-Lucan, the sole mining company in the Periphery would construct a station to supervise their operations directly. The station was a truly large complex housing habitation, Mining and even orbital shipyards that created the First ships in this Region."
	description "Thales was abandoned after a solar flare from Pherkad struck the station during a routine maintenance. Evacuations were issued to try and restore the station before it could fall from orbit, after tense weeks the station was stabilized but it was considered to damaged to salvage it."
	spaceport "What's left of the main spaceport is littered with a lot of debris, most useful stuff was removed long ago by the people or scavengers but outside of that the place is untouched since the Evacuation."

planet Winter

	landscape land/snow18
	description `The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Alzyria decided to build a manufacturing center and research facility here. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`
	description `	The temperatures have risen measurably since the arrival of the human colonists, but without more intentional efforts it may be another century before the planet warms enough to be truly comfortable to live on.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is built on a large rock outcropping, with brilliant blue glaciers flowing to either side down into a lake below. The sight is stunning, and all the more appealing because you are able to view it from behind plate glass windows, in the warmth of the spaceport, rather than in the frigid air outside. Above you, several layers of clouds are scudding across the sky in different directions.`
	spaceport `	Faded posters on the walls advise you to buy an estate on Winter now before prices skyrocket. The posters depict children playing in a lush green landscape while their grandparents stand by, looking quietly pleased with the wisdom of their investment.`

	description "When the First Expedition arrived to the Southern Periphery, they came to this planet and detected a massive amount of metals in this planet. Eager to profit from it Vale-Lucan established their first mining operations here, the martian like atmosphere was hard but manageable on the early colonists. Wolfradia managed to prosper to the point that many rival corporations fought to control this system. "
	description "As Exo-Mining became popular for civilians and private companies, Wolfradia slowly dwindled in population as space travel became affordable. The evacuation of Thales station being the only time it surged in population."
	spaceport "The spaceport is situated in a large crater to protect from the Wolfradian storms, the starport connects directly to the largest mining town on the planet."
