	description "Star Cabs, created in the Periphery, are one of the smallest starships a captain can afford. Built during the early days of the Republic, Star Cabs were designed by Moreau Shipworks (now Paradeigm Group) as an affordable first ship for a star captain and as such it is very barebones compared to a typical shuttle. Although considered obsolete by many today, Star Cabs are still used to train first time pilots in many transport fleets or as training dummies, continuing its service more than three centuries later."

	description "The Moreau Shipworks's Navant are a series of multi-role ships, but are classified as a Utility since that is their primary function."
	description "Built as the Periphery consolidated, the Navants were designed to ferry goods and passengers in long distance treks with enough defense to escape the occasional pirate raid. Their versatility became a strong suit and today they are used from transport to mining to freight of goods. "
	description "While it fell out of favor by Southbound's Clipper and Argosy the Navants are still utilized by the Periphery's services."
