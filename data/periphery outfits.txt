# Epsil Notes: the main themes that I got for the Southern Rim's new ships are that they are bulky to withstand pirate attacks, modular since many of the designs were converted from civilian ones to speed up development.


# ANTI-MISSILES
# Based on Zoura's ideas from HSO.
# The south doesn't have any planets that sell anti-missiles separate from ships. While it's not impossible to import things, it makes more sense to me to have them make their own anti-missiles. 
# Epsil Notes: I will retain the Tarazed origin, the Marksman will become available at the start of the game and when war starts the Sharpshooter will be unlocked in an event.

	description "The inability to import Anti-Missile Turrets from Lovelace Labs without heavy duties has forced the Southern Defense Pact to develop a local anti-missile system, so that they can more easily protect southern merchant convoys from ever-increasing pirate attacks. Drawing from the Quarg's long-ranged anti-missile systems, Tarazed's new offering focuses not on delivering as much anti-missile as possible, but firing more accurately over longer ranges."

	description "A heavy counterpart to the Marksman with its range and precision pushed to its limits, the Sharpshooter provides a wide area of missile denial for a ship mounted with one."
	description "Built during the escalating tensions with the Navy, Tarazed was forced to accelerate the deployment of the Sharpshooter by the now established Free Worlds, with Paradeigm providing financial and technical expertise to make it doable."
	



# WEAPONS
# Before the war, Paradeigm already experimented with weaponry, like the Syndicate, wanting to have a equivalent for the Navy Particle cannon. Unlike the Syndicate though, they don't have ships large enough to accommodate them so instead they aim to replace energy blasters. It results in the development of the MAGAUSS weaponry, bit inferior to the energy blasters in terms of reload but its long range permits spaceships to fight outside the range of the targets guns.

	description "While the rest of human space focused on energy weaponry and the Deep on lasers, the Periphery's mineral wealth allowed the development of material sciences to the point that electromagnetic weaponry became very common in the Periphery."
	description "The MAGNETIC GAUSS Gun (MAGAUSS) are long range weapons that while a bit on the underwhelming side compared to the competition, it can use its long rance to attack at a safe distance, making it very useful as a support weapon."

# UTILITY
# there are two areas that Paradeigm will develop over the course of the war: superconductive materials and active systems.

	description "Paradiegm's development of superconductive materials led to a number of applications in all kinds of fields, one of them being active cooler outfits. The Brume is a cryogenic system designed to prevent heat passively, but when temperature reaches a critical point it can increase its heat reduction at the cost of some power."

	description "The discovery of the Messier method for fusion reactions led to a new generation of fusion reactors. Messier Generators work in two stages by igniting a capsule of hyperfuel by using charged particles, then in stage two: just as the reaction begins two powerful magnets start compressing the plasma surpassing the electron barrier and generating fusion. The reaction is then collected and converted into electricity."
	description 'The Messier M302 "Curie" is the first generator being small enough to be deployed for starships.'
