	planet "Winter"
		description `The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Alzyria decided to build a manufacturing center and research facility here. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`
		description `	The temperatures have risen measurably since the arrival of the human colonists, but without more intentional efforts it may be another century before the planet warms enough to be truly comfortable to live on.`
		description `	Winter is home to the Free Worlds Conservatory, a new university that is focused on making terraforming technology and expertise available at a reasonable price, as well as on ecological protection and renewal.`
